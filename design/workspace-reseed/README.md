# In-place workspace reseeding

- [Repeatable in-place reflink reseeding](reseed0.gpt6a.md) — recommended
  `jw reseed` interface, prepared-source workflow, ignored dependencies, stock-JJ
  sparse-prefill mechanism, local verification, and implementation acceptance checks.

Existing behavior: [CoW creation](../../README.md#copy-on-write-workspaces).
Integration boundary: [architecture](../../docs/architecture.md#module-map).

Operator-facing implementation guidance: [reseed an existing workspace](../../docs/reseed.md)
starts with one-off named use and covers optional configuration, explicit ignored
replacement, full JJ-only target restrictions, and pending-operation recovery.
The model-suffixed proposal above remains the design and experiment evidence,
not a mutable command reference.
